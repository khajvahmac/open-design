# Open-Design
A web application designed to connect UX designers with open source/low budget projects.

Solo and open source developers can make pretty impressive applications. One thing that keeps those projects away from public is the UI design. A lot of amazing projects go unnoticed just because their UIs are not qute enough and/or are not user-friendly enough. On the contrary, their alternatives gain market share just because they are good looking. All this because low(or no)-budget projects simply can't afford UX designers. They can, however, attract many developers who are happy to contribute, because of open source movement. Why not have a way for UX designers to contribute too? Will have something to show in their CVs and will contribute to FOSS projects.
